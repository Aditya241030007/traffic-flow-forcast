# Traffic Flow Forecasting using Time Series

## Project Overview
This is a **self-initiated project** analyzing and forecasting daily traffic flow using time series modeling.  
The goal is to demonstrate forecasting and data analysis skills relevant to transportation planning.
## Objectives
- Simulate 60 days of **traffic volume data** with weekday/weekend variability.  
- Apply **ARIMA time series model** to forecast short-term traffic flow.  
- Visualize actual vs. predicted traffic volume for the next 14 days.
## Tools & Libraries
- **R** (base + forecast, ggplot2)  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: ARIMA model  
- **Visualization**: ggplot2  
## Key Results
- **ARIMA model automatically selected** based on AIC minimization.  
- Forecasts show **clear weekday/weekend seasonality** in traffic volume.  
- Visualization highlights prediction intervals for short-term traffic flow.
